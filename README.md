MRW is a small fps game to play with friends,
it's still on progress but most of the core mechanics are already working:
+ finding players
+ synced gameplay
+ taking/dealing damage
+ scoreboard
+ timer and end score
+ late join without breaking the game (even if after the match ended, you will still be in-sync with others)

Still messing :
- A.I.s (bots will make for a good survival mode)
- reconnection (without losing in-match progress)
- host migration? (player shouldn't stop player just because the host don't want to, right?)

And finally, it will need (better models, more weapons, more/better maps, art style, sound effects, music) basicly non-programing stuff.   :/
